# srjc_spider

This is the scraper for the srjc scheduler

In order to run

# Authentication
##  You must either get the proper credientials from be or josh Alan to connect to the live databse
##
## else inside of pipeline and the connect function, you must declare your own db and credentials

# Libraries
## Uses a combination of scrapy and Beautiful soup
## A beta using selenium has been provided inside of srjc_selenium

This shows how to properly yield and use the twisted-scrapy framework, more to come involving middleware
specficially for other colleges support and hopefuly a net to just scrape all at once for multiple colleges

# TODOS 
## 1. Syntax simplification
## 2. Support for classes that do not meet at a set time
## 3. Support for classes that do not have sections names

In progress: Current version is 0.1.0
